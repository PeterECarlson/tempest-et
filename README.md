## Tempest Evapotranspiration

This is a project to convert data from my WeatherFlow Tempest weather station into an estimate
of daily evapotranspiration. For now, this will be reference ET (50 cm alfalfa with adequate water supply).

Future versions may also incorporate soil moisture and simple crop-specific corrections to reference ET.
